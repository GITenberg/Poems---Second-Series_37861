PREFACE
</H3>

<P>
Three years ago I published a volume called <I>Poems: First Series</I>,
which contained a collection of what I had written between 1905 and
March, 1918.
</P>

<P>
The present collection contains all that I have written since then.
<I>The Birds</I> and nine shorter poems were published in a small booklet in
1919; <I>The Moon</I> was separately published in 1920; but the majority of
the poems here printed appear in book form for the first time, and
twelve have never previously been published.
</P>

<P>
The poems are as nearly as possible in chronological order, except that
the group called <I>An Epilogue</I> should have been dated 1917.

(<I>To Edmund Gosse</I>)<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Within mankind's duration, so they say,<BR>
Khephren and Ninus lived but yesterday.<BR>
Asia had no name till man was old<BR>
And long had learned the use of iron and gold;<BR>
And æons had passed, when the first corn was planted,<BR>
Since first the use of syllables was granted.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Men were on earth while climates slowly swung,<BR>
Fanning wide zones to heat and cold, and long<BR>
Subsidence turned great continents to sea,<BR>
And seas dried up, dried up interminably,<BR>
Age after age; enormous seas were dried<BR>
Amid wastes of land.  And the last monsters died.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Earth wore another face.  O since that prime<BR>
Man with how many works has sprinkled time!<BR>
Hammering, hewing, digging tunnels, roads;<BR>
Building ships, temples, multiform abodes.<BR>
How, for his body's appetites, his toils<BR>
Have conquered all earth's products, all her soils;<BR>
And in what thousand thousand shapes of art<BR>
He has tried to find a language for his heart!<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Never at rest, never content or tired:<BR>
Insatiate wanderer, marvellously fired,<BR>
Most grandly piling and piling into the air<BR>
Stones that will topple or arch he knows not where.<BR>
And yet did I, this spring, think it more strange,<BR>
More grand, more full of awe, than all that change,<BR>
And lovely and sweet and touching unto tears,<BR>
That through man's chronicled and unchronicled years,<BR>
And even into that unguessable beyond<BR>
The water-hen has nested by a pond,<BR>
Weaving dry flags into a beaten floor,<BR>
The one sure product of her only lore.<BR>
Low on a ledge above the shadowed water<BR>
Then, when she heard no men, as nature taught her,<BR>
Flashing around with busy scarlet bill<BR>
She built that nest, her nest, and builds it still.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O let your strong imagination turn<BR>
The great wheel backward, until Troy unburn,<BR>
And then unbuild, and seven Troys below<BR>
Rise out of death, and dwindle, and outflow,<BR>
Till all have passed, and none has yet been there:<BR>
Back, ever back.  Our birds still crossed the air;<BR>
Beyond our myriad changing generations<BR>
Still built, unchanged, their known inhabitations.<BR>
A million years before Atlantis was<BR>
Our lark sprang from some hollow in the grass,<BR>
Some old soft hoof-print in a tussock's shade;<BR>
And the wood-pigeon's smooth snow-white eggs were laid,<BR>
High amid green pines' sunset-coloured shafts,<BR>
And rooks their villages of twiggy rafts<BR>
Set on the tops of elms, where elms grew then,<BR>
And still the thumbling tit and perky wren<BR>
Popped through the tiny doors of cosy balls<BR>
And the blackbird lined with moss his high-built walls;<BR>
A round mud cottage held the thrush's young,<BR>
And straws from the untidy sparrow's hung.<BR>
And, skimming forktailed in the evening air,<BR>
When man first was were not the martins there?<BR>
Did not those birds some human shelter crave,<BR>
And stow beneath the cornice of his cave<BR>
Their dry tight cups of clay?  And from each door<BR>
Peeped on a morning wiseheads three or four.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Yes, daw and owl, curlew and crested hern,<BR>
Kingfisher, mallard, water-rail and tern,<BR>
Chaffinch and greenfinch, wagtail, stonechat, ruff,<BR>
Whitethroat and robin, fly-catcher and chough,<BR>
Missel-thrush, magpie, sparrow-hawk and jay,<BR>
Built, those far ages gone, in this year's way.<BR>
And the first man who walked the cliffs of Rame,<BR>
As I this year, looked down and saw the same<BR>
Blotches of rusty red on ledge and cleft<BR>
With grey-green spots on them, while right and left<BR>
A dizzying tangle of gulls were floating and flying,<BR>
Wheeling and crossing and darting, crying and crying,<BR>
Circling and crying, over and over and over,<BR>
Crying with swoop and hover and fall and recover.<BR>
And below on a rock against the grey sea fretted,<BR>
Pipe-necked and stationary and silhouetted,<BR>
Cormorants stood in a wise, black, equal row<BR>
Above the nests and long blue eggs we know.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
O delicate chain over all the ages stretched,<BR>
O dumb tradition from what far darkness fetched:<BR>
Each little architect with its one design<BR>
Perpetual, fixed and right in stuff and line,<BR>
Each little ministrant who knows one thing,<BR>
One learnèd rite to celebrate the spring.<BR>
Whatever alters else on sea or shore,<BR>
These are unchanging: man must still explore.<BR>

A DOG'S DEATH<BR>
</H3>

<P CLASS="poem">
The loose earth falls in the grave like a peaceful regular breathing;<BR>
Too like, for I was deceived a moment by the sound:<BR>
It has covered the heap of bracken that the gardener laid above him;<BR>
Quiet the spade swings: there we have now his mound.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
A patch of fresh earth on the floor of the wood's renewing chamber:<BR>
All around is grass and moss and the hyacinth's dark green sprouts:<BR>
And oaks are above that were old when his fiftieth sire was a puppy:<BR>
And far away in the garden I hear the children's shouts.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Their joy is remote as a dream.  It is strange how we buy our sorrow<BR>
For the touch of perishing things, idly, with open eyes;<BR>
How we give our hearts to brutes that will die in a few seasons,<BR>
Nor trouble what we do when we do it; nor would have it otherwise.<BR>

Long ago I knew that brown integument,<BR>
Like a dead husk, had dormant life within it,<BR>
And waited till a first white point appeared<BR>
Which shot into a naked stiff pale spike<BR>
That grew.<BR>
I knew this was not all;<BR>
Nothing I said as greener you grew and taller,<BR>
But dreamed alone of the day when your bud would unsheathe,<BR>
And silently swell, and at last your crown would break<BR>
Filling the air with clouds of colour and fragrance,<BR>
Radiant waves, odours of immortality.<BR>

In a pot of earth I watered and tended you,<BR>
Breaking the clods and soaking the earth with water<BR>
That fed your roots and eased your way to the light.<BR>

You are mine, and only I know you,<BR>

I find my mind as it were a deep water.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Sometimes I play with a thought and hammer and bend it,<BR>
Till tired and displeased with that I toss it away,<BR>
Or absently let it slip to the yawning water:<BR>
And down it sinks, forgotten for many a day.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
But a time comes when tide or tempest washes it<BR>
High on the beach, and I find that shape of mine,<BR>
Or I haul it out from the depths on some casual rope,<BR>
Or, passing over that spot in quiet shine,<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
I see, where my boat's shadow makes deep the water,<BR>
A patch of colour, far down, from the bottom apart,<BR>
A wavering sign like the gleam from an ancient anchor,<BR>
Brown fixing and fleeting flakes; and I feel my heart<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Wake to a strange excitement; so that I stop,<BR>
Put up my paddles and dredge with a careful net:<BR>
And I catch it, and see it stir, and feel its weight,<BR>
And pull till it nears and breaks from the water wet.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And my eyes dwell on that old abandoned thing<BR>
Recovered by chance.  For the shape I had found so dull<BR>

In bed I lie, and my thoughts come filing by,<BR>

But O last, you group of merry ones!<BR>
Lord knows when I saw you before, but I met you once,<BR>
The whole collection of you, impudent-eyed;<BR>
And now, rosy and grinning, with linked arms<BR>
You go swingingly by, turning your faces to mine,<BR>
I laugh aloud; you bad lots; you are a secret,<BR>
That nobody else knows.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
And you it was that made me break the procession<BR>
(While memory gave me still the power of summons),<BR>
And call up all I could of a half-hour's thoughts<BR>
To parade them across this proscenium of my skull<BR>
In the order they came in, more carefully recognising<BR>
The old, and remarking which have developed or changed.<BR>

There are one or two more of you now than once there were.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Into the pits of my heart and brain,<BR>
My eyes, ears, nose, tongue, fingers, like five gardeners<BR>
Are shovelling sights, sounds, odours, savours, contacts,<BR>
While I, their master, casually nod, and most times<BR>
Stand idly by, looking at something else,<BR>
Forgetting that the work is going on<BR>
And only fully conscious of my servants<BR>
When something they move is consonant with my mood<BR>
And draws my notice; or some other thing,<BR>
More strange than usual or stronger in its impact,<BR>
Makes them exclaim and call to bid me watch.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And then in a ground of more than our dimensions<BR>
Those quietly flowing cascades of things are hid.<BR>
They are buried in those illimitable fields,<BR>
And ever as they are swallowed by the earth<BR>
The steady hours passing in procession<BR>
Walk over them and trample them well down<BR>
Out of sight, levelling all the soil.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
Then some time my returning feet uncover them<BR>
(My slaves are all agog with recognition)<BR>
Or else perhaps I come and idly dig<BR>
To see what thing I can find, and out there comes<BR>
Some old form buried twenty years ago<BR>
Now called a memory.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Or marking well the place where one was put<BR>
Find it and more, drawn thither under the ground,<BR>
Tangled with others as flower-roots with roots<BR>
Into a new festoon, or one old image,<BR>
Wearing others like gems.  And that's creation.<BR>

Mother of Rome, delight of gods and men,<BR>
Beloved Venus, who under the fleeting stars<BR>
Fillest the freighted sea and earth's ripe fields,<BR>
O since through thee alone all forms of life<BR>
Are born, and climb into the sun's sweet light,<BR>
Goddess, before whose lovely advancing feet<BR>
The winds and towering clouds scatter and flee,<BR>

And the sea falls into a shining calm,<BR>
And the assuaged heavens mellow with light.<BR>
For when the spring-like face of day awakes,<BR>
And the West Wind, unloosed, flies procreant forth,<BR>
Then first the coursing birds, smitten at heart,<BR>
Betray, Lady, thy entrance and thy power,<BR>
And then the beasts caper in happy pastures<BR>
And swim swift floods; so all created things,<BR>
Captive to thee, drawn by their own desire,<BR>
Stray through the world where'er thy presence leads.<BR>
Through all the seas and hills and swelling streams,<BR>
Wing-fluttering woods and green, luxuriant plains,<BR>
Thou harryest them with lust, that none shall fail<BR>
To carry their eternal races on.<BR>

Since then thou art sole queen of all that Is,<BR>
And without thee to help can nothing rise<BR>

Now that of all that Is I strive to sing,<BR>

For his sake, chiefly, fill my words with life.<BR>

I.  THE FLUKE<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
For two years you went<BR>
Through all the worst of it,<BR>
Men fell around you, but you did not fall.<BR>
On the Somme when the air was a sea<BR>
Of contesting flashes and clouds of smoke,<BR>
Your gunners fell fast but you got never a scratch.<BR>
And once when you watched from a village tower<BR>
(At Longueval, was it?) between our guns and theirs<BR>
As men fought in the houses below,<BR>
A shell from an English battery came<BR>
And tore a hole in the tower below you,<BR>
But you were not hurt and remained observing.<BR>
</P>

<P CLASS="poem">
And now,<BR>
A casual shell has come<BR>
And pierced your head,<BR>
And the men who were with you, uninjured,<BR>
Carried you back,<BR>
And you died on the way.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
When we've greeted each other again,<BR>

You will look in the fire for a minute<BR>
And then you will say, with a yawn,<BR>
"Well, when do you think this damned war will be over?"<BR>
And I shall say nothing, or something as empty as nothing.<BR>
But I am forgetting.<BR>
We shall not greet each other again;<BR>
You will not ask that question again.<BR>

Well, it's no good brooding.<BR>
The past cannot return.<BR>
They have killed him and buried him.<BR>
Many men as good as he have gone:<BR>
They were good men even if one never knew them.<BR>
It is a just and honourable war.<BR>
He went in readily at the start, though he hated it,<BR>
And one would not have had him do otherwise.<BR>
And, thank God, he did the job well<BR>
That had to be done.<BR>
He has suffered with millions of others<BR>
For the sake of the future's peace,<BR>
And ungrudgingly laid down his life<BR>
In the cleanest of England's wars.<BR>
There is no room for regret here, only for pride.<BR>

IV.  THE LANDSCAPE<BR>
</H4>

<P CLASS="poem">
You said, that first winter,<BR>
That the landscape around Ypres<BR>
Reminded you of Chinese paintings:<BR>
The green plain, striped with trenches,<BR>
The few trees on the plain,<BR>
And the puffs of smoke sprinkled over the plain.<BR>
You said, when the war was over,<BR>
That you would record that green desolation<BR>
In flat colours and lines<BR>
As a Chinese artist would.<BR>
That is what you were going to do.<BR>
The plain is still there.<BR>

There was a day, when I, if that was I,<BR>

What deaths men have died, not fighting but impotent.<BR>
Hung on the wire, between trenches, burning and freezing,<BR>
Groaning for water with armies of men so near;<BR>
The fall over cliff, the clutch at the rootless grass,<BR>
The beach rushing up, the whirling, the turning head first;<BR>
Stiff writhings of strychnine, taken in error or haste,<BR>
Angina pectoris, shudders of the heart;<BR>
Failure and crushing by flying weight to the ground,<BR>
Claws and jaws, the stink of a lion's breath;<BR>
Swimming, a white belly, a crescent of teeth,<BR>
Agony, and a spirting shredded limb<BR>
And crimson blood staining the green water;<BR>
And, horror of horrors, the slow grind on the rack,<BR>
The breaking bones, the stretching and bursting skin,<BR>
Perpetual fainting and waking to see above<BR>
The down-thrust mocking faces of cruel men,<BR>
With the power of mercy, who gloat upon shrieks for mercy.<BR>

O pity me, God!  O God make tolerable,<BR>
Make tolerable the end that awaits for me,<BR>

That I shrink not nor scream, gripped by the jaws of the vice;<BR>
For the thought of it turns me sick, and my heart stands still,<BR>
Knocks and stands still.  O fearful, fearful Shadow,<BR>
Kill me, let me die to escape the terror of thee!<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lighthouse lamp upon the little pier<BR>

Waiting I knew not what uplifted curtain,<BR>

The raw, rough, timber back of the new-made mound.<BR>
Quicker!  The place is swarming!  Around, around<BR>
Till the edge is reached, and we see a patch of green,<BR>
Two masts with a crossbar, tapering, white and clean,<BR>
And confluent rows of people that merge and die<BR>
In a flutter of faces where the grand-stand blocks the sky.<BR>
We hurry along, past ragged files of faces,<BR>
Flushing and quick, peering for empty places.<BR>
I see one above me, I step and prise and climb,<BR>
And stand and turn and breathe and look at the time,<BR>
Survey the field, and note with superior glance,<BR>
The anxious bobbing fools who still advance.<BR>

Ah!  They are coming still.  It is filling up.<BR>
It is full.  They come.  There is almost an hour to go,<BR>
Yet all find room, the dribbles of black disappear<BR>
In the solid piles around that empty green,<BR>
We are packed and ready now.  They might as well start,<BR>
But two-forty-five was their time, and it's only ten past,<BR>
And it's got to be lived through.  I haven't a newspaper,<BR>
I wish I could steal that little parson's book.<BR>
I count three minutes slowly: they seem like an hour;<BR>
And then I change feet and loosen the brim of my hat,<BR>
And curse the crawling of time.  Oh body, body!<BR>
Why did I order you here, to stand and feel tired,<BR>
To ache and ache when the time will never pass,<BR>
In this buzzing crowd, before all those laden housetops,<BR>
Around this turf, under the lid of the sky?<BR>
I fumble my watch again: it is two-twenty:<BR>
Twenty-five minutes to wait.  One, two, three, four,<BR>
Five, six, seven, eight: what is the good of counting?<BR>
It won't be here any quicker, aching hips,<BR>
Bored brain, unquiet heart, you are doomed to wait.<BR>
Why did I make you come?  We have been before,<BR>
Struggling with time, fatigued and dull and alone<BR>
In all this tumultuous, chattering, happy crowd<BR>
That never knew pain and never questions its acts...<BR>
Never questions?  Do not deceive yourself.<BR>
Look at the faces around you, active and gay,<BR>
They are lined, there are brains behind them, breasts beneath them,<BR>
They have only escaped for an hour, and even now<BR>
Many, like you, have not escaped; and away<BR>
Across the field those faces ascending in tiers,<BR>
Each face is a story, a tragedy and a doubt;<BR>
And the teams where they wait, in the sacred place to the right,<BR>
Are bewildered souls, who have heard of and brooded on death,<BR>
And thought about God.  But this is a football match;<BR>
And anyhow I don't feel equal to thinking,<BR>
And I'm certain the teams don't; they've something better to do.<BR>
It is half-past two, and, thank Heaven, a minute over.<BR>
We are all here now.  The laggards have all booked seats<BR>
And stroll in lordly leisure along the front.<BR>
What a man!  Six foot, silk hat, brown face, moustache!<BR>
What a fat complacent parson, snuggling down<BR>
In the chair there, among all his cackling ladies!<BR>
I have seen that youth before.  My neighbour now<BR>
On my left shouts out to a college friend below us,<BR>
"Tommy!  Hallo!  Do you think we are going to beat 'em?"<BR>
My watch.  Twenty-to-three.  That lot went quickly;<BR>
Five minutes more is nothing; I'm lively now<BR>
And fit for a five-mile run.  One, two, three, four...<BR>
It isn't worth bothering now, it's all but here,<BR>
Here, here; a rustle, a murmur, a ready silence,<BR>
A billowing cheer&mdash;why, here they come, running and passing,<BR>
The challenging team!  By God, what magnificent fellows!<BR>
They have dropped the ball, they pause, they sweep onward again,<BR>
And so to the end.  Here are the rest of them,<BR>
Swingingly up the field and back as they came,<BR>
With the cheers swelling and swelling.  They disappear,<BR>
And out, like wind upon water, come their rivals,<BR>
With cheers swelling and swelling, to run and turn<BR>
And vanish; and now they are all come out together,<BR>
Two teams walking, touch-judges and referee.<BR>
And they all line up, dotted about like chessmen,<BR>
And the multitude holds its breath, and awaits the start.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Whistle!  A kick!  A rush, a scramble, a scrum,<BR>
The forwards are busy already, the halves hover round,<BR>
The three-quarters stand in backwards diverging lines,<BR>
Eagerly bent, atoe, with elbows back,<BR>
And hands that would grasp at a ball, trembling to start,<BR>
While the solid backs vigilant stray about<BR>
And the crowd gives out a steady resolute roar,<BR>
Like the roar of a sea; a scrum, a whistle, a scrum;<BR>
A burst, a whistle, a scrum, a kick into touch;<BR>
All in the middle of the field.  He is tossing it in,<BR>
They have got it and downed it, and whurry, oh, here they come,<BR>
Streaming like a waterfall, oh, he has knocked it on,<BR>
Right at our feet, and the scrum is formed again,<BR>
And everything seems to stop while they pack and go crooked.<BR>
The scrum-half beats them straight with a rough smack<BR>
While he holds the ball, debonair....  How it all comes back,<BR>
As the steam goes up of their breath and their sweating trunks!<BR>
The head low down, the eyes that swim to the ground,<BR>
The mesh of ownerless knees, the patch of dark earth,<BR>
The ball that comes in, and wedges and jerks, and is caught,<BR>
And sticks, the dense intoxicant smell of sweat,<BR>
The grip on the moisture of jerseys, the sickening urge<BR>
That seems powerless to help; the desperate final shove<BR>
That somehow is timed with a general effort, the sweep<BR>
Onward, while enemies reel, and the whole scrum turns<BR>
And we torrent away with the ball.  Oh, I know it all....<BR>
I know it....  Where are they? ...  Far on the opposite line,<BR>
Aimlessly kicking while the forwards stand gaping about,<BR>
Deprived of their work.  Convergence.  They are coming again,<BR>
They are scrumming again below, red hair, black cap,<BR>
And a horde of dark colourless heads and straining backs;<BR>
A voice rasps up through the howl of the crowd around<BR>
(Triumphant now in possession over all the rest<BR>
Of crowds who have lost the moving treasure to us)&mdash;<BR>
"Push, you devils!"  They push, and push, and push;<BR>
The opponents yield, the fortress wall goes down,<BR>
The ram goes through, an irresistible rush<BR>
Crosses the last white line, and tumbles down,<BR>
And the ball is there.  A try!  A try!  A try!<BR>
The shout from the host we are assaults the sky.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
Deep silence.  Line up by the goal-posts.  A man lying down,<BR>
Poising the pointed ball, slanted away,<BR>
And another who stands, and hesitates, and runs<BR>
And lunges out with his foot, and the ball soars up,<BR>
While the opposite forwards rush below it in vain,<BR>
And curves to the posts, and passes them just outside.<BR>
The touch-judge's flag hangs still.  It was only a try!<BR>
Three points to us.  The roar is continuous now,<BR>
The game swings to and fro like a pendulum<BR>
Struck by a violent hand.  But the impetus wanes,<BR>
The forwards are getting tired, and all the outsides<BR>
Run weakly, pass loosely; there are one or two penalty kicks,<BR>
And a feeble attempt from a mark.  The ball goes out<BR>
Over the heads of the crowd, comes wearily back;<BR>
And, lingering about in mid-field, the tedious game<BR>
Seems for a while a thing interminable.<BR>
And nothing happens, till all of a sudden a shrill<BR>
Blast from the whistle flies out and arrests the game.<BR>
Half-time ... Unlocking ... The players are all erect,<BR>
Easy and friendly, standing about in groups,<BR>
Figures in sculpture, better for mud-stained clothes;<BR>
Couples from either side chatting and laughing,<BR>
And chewing lemons, and throwing the rinds away.<BR>

<P CLASS="poem">
The pause is over.  They part from each other, sift out;<BR>
The backs trot out to their stations, the forwards spread;<BR>
The captains beckon with hands, and the ball goes off<BR>
To volleys and answering volleys of harsher cheers;<BR>
For the top of the hill is past, we course to the close.<BR>
We've a three-point lead.  Can we keep it?  It isn't enough.<BR>
We have always heard their three-quarters were better than ours,<BR>
If they once get the ball.  They have got it, he runs, he passes,<BR>
The centre dodges, is tackled, passes in time<BR>
To the other centre who goes like a bird to the left<BR>
And flings it out to the wing.  The goal is open;<BR>
He has only to run as he can.  No, the back is across,<BR>
He has missed him; he has him; they topple, head over heels,<BR>
And the ball bumps along into touch.  They are stuck on our line;<BR>
Scrum after scrum, with those dangerous threes standing waiting,<BR>
Threat after threat forced back; a save, a return;<BR>
And the same thing over again, till the ball goes out<BR>
Almost unnoticed, and before we can see what is done,<BR>
That centre has kicked, he has thought of the four points,<BR>
The ball soars, slackens, keeps upright with effort,<BR>
Then floats between posts and falls, ignored, to the ground,<BR>
Its grandeur gone, while the touch-judge flaps his flag,<BR>
And the multitude becomes an enormous din<BR>
Which dies as the game resumes, and then rises again,<BR>
As battle of cry of triumph and counter-cry,<BR>
Defiant, like great waves surging against each other.<BR>
They work to the other corner, they stay there long;<BR>
They push and wheel, there are runs that come to nothing,<BR>
Till the noise wanes, and a curious silence comes.<BR>
They lead by a point, their crowd is sobered now,<BR>
Anxious still lest a sudden chance should come,<BR>
Or a sudden resource of power in mysterious foes<BR>
Which may dash them again from their new precarious peak,<BR>
Whilst we in our hearts are aware of the chilling touch<BR>
Of loss, of a fatal thing irrevocable,<BR>
Feel the time fly to the dreaded last wail of the whistle,<BR>
And see our team as desperate waves that dash<BR>
Against a wall of rock, to be scattered in spray.<BR>
Yet fervour comes back, for the players have no thought for the past<BR>
Except as a goad to new effort, not they will be chilled:<BR>
Fiercer and faster they fight, a grimness comes<BR>
Into shoving and running and tackling and handing off.<BR>
We are heeling the ball now cleanly, time after time<BR>
Our half picks it up and instantly jabs it away,<BR>
And the beautiful swift diagonal quarter-line<BR>
Tips it across for the wing to go like a stag<BR>
Till he's cornered and falls and the gate swings shut again.<BR>
Thirty fighting devils, ten thousand throats,<BR>
Thundering joy at each pass and tackle and punt,<BR>
Yet the consciousness grows that the time approaches the end,<BR>
The threat of conclusion grows like a spreading tree<BR>
And casts its shadow on all the anxious people,<BR>
And is fully known when they stop as a man's knocked out<BR>
And limps from the field with his arms round two comrades' necks.<BR>
The gradual time seems to have suddenly leapt....<BR>
And all this while the unheeded winter sky<BR>
Has faded, and the air gone bluer and mistier.<BR>
The players, when they drift away to a corner<BR>
Distant from us, seem to have left our world.<BR>
We see the struggling forms, tangling and tumbling,<BR>
We hear the noise from the featureless mass around them,<BR>
But the dusk divides.  Finality seems to have come.<BR>
Nothing can happen now.  The attention drifts.<BR>
There's a pause; I become a separate thing again,<BR>
Almost forget the game, forget my neighbours,<BR>
And the noise fades in my ears to a dim rumour.<BR>
I watch the lines and colours of field and buildings,<BR>
So simple and soft and few in the vapoury air,<BR>
I am held by the brightening orange lights of the matches<BR>
Perpetually pricking the haze across the ground,<BR>
And the scene is tinged with a quiet melancholy,<BR>
The harmonious sadness of twilight on willowed waters,<BR>
Still avenues or harbours seen from the sea.<BR>
Yet a louder shout recalls me, I wake again,<BR>
Find there are two minutes left, and it's nearly over,<BR>
See a few weaklings already walking out,<BR>
Caring more to avoid a crush with the crowd<BR>
Than to give the last stroke to a ritual of courtesy<BR>
And a work of intangible art.  But we're all getting ready,<BR>
Hope gone, and fear, except in the battling teams.<BR>
Regret ... a quick movement of hazy forms,<BR>
Oh quiet, oh look, there is something happening,<BR>
Sudden one phantom form on the other wing<BR>
Emerges from nothingness, is singled out,<BR>
Curving in a long sweep like a flying gull,<BR>
Through the thick fog, swifter as borne by wind,<BR>
Swerves at the place where the corner-flag must be,<BR>
And runs, by Heaven he's over! and runs, and runs,<BR>
And our hearts leap, and our sticks go up in the air<BR>
And our hats whirl, and we lose ourselves in a yell<BR>
For a try behind the posts.  We have beaten them!<BR>

Outside; and a mob hailing cabs, besieging the station,<BR>
Sticks, overcoats, scarves, bowler hats, intensified faces,<BR>
Rushes, apologies, voices: "Simpson's at seven,"<BR>
"Hallo, Jim," "See you next term," "I've just seen old Peter."<BR>
They go to their homes, to catch trains, all over the city,<BR>
All over England; or, many, to make a good night of it,<BR>
Eat oysters, drink more than usual, dispute of the match.<BR>
For the match is all over, and what, being done, does it matter?<BR>
What happened last year?  I was here; I should know, but I don't.<BR>
Next year there will be another, with another result,<BR>
Just such another crowd, just as excited.<BR>
And after next year, for a year and a year and a year,<BR>
Till customs have changed and things crumbled and all this strife<BR>
Is a dim word from the past.  Why, even to-night,<BR>
When the last door has been locked, the last groundsman will go,<BR>
Leaving that field which was conquered and full of men,<BR>
With darkened houses around, void and awake,<BR>
Silently talking to the silent travelling moon:<BR>
"The day passed.  They have gone again.  They will die."<BR>
To-night in the moon the neighbouring roofs will lie<BR>
Lonely and still, all of their dwellers in bed;<BR>
The phantom stands will glisten, the goal-posts rise<BR>
Slanting their shadows across the grass, as calm<BR>
As though they had never challenged an eager swarm,<BR>
Or any ball had made their crossbars quiver.<BR>
Clouds will pass, and the city's murmur fade,<BR>
And the open field await its destiny<BR>
Of transient invaders coming and going.<BR>
What was the point of it?  Why did the heart leap high<BR>
Putting reason back, to watch that fugitive play?<BR>
Why not?  We must all distract ourselves with toys.<BR>
Not a brick nor a heap remains, the more durable product<BR>
Of all that; effort and pain.  Yet, sooner or later,<BR>
As much may be said of any human game,<BR>
War, politics, art, building, planting and ploughing,<BR>
The explorer's freezing, the astronomer's searching of stars,<BR>
The philosopher's fight through the thickening webs of thought,<BR>
And the writing of poems: a hand, a stir and a sinking.<BR>
And so, no more, of the general game of the Race,<BR>
That cannot know of its origin or its end,<BR>
But strives, for their own sake, its courage and skill<BR>
To increase, till Frost or a Flying Flame calls "Time!"<BR>
I have seen this day men in the beauty of movement,<BR>
A gallant jaw set, the form of a hero that flew,<BR>
Cunning, a selfless flinging of self in the fray,<BR>
Strength, compassion, control, the obeying of laws,<BR>
Victory, and a struggle against defeat.<BR>
I think that the Power that gave us the bodies we have,<BR>
Can only be praised by our use of the things He gave,<BR>
That we are not here to turn our backs to the sun,<BR>
Or to scorn the delight of our limbs.  And for those who have eyes<BR>
The beauty of this is the same as the beauty of flowers,<BR>
And of eagles and lions and mountains and oceans and stars,<BR>
And I care not, but rather am glad that the thought will recur<BR>
That in Egypt the muscles moved under the shining skins<BR>
As here, and in Greece where Olympian champions died,<BR>
And in isles long ago, where never a record was kept.<BR>
And now I'll go home, and open a bottle of port,<BR>
And think upon beauty and God and the wonder of love,<BR>
That laughs at the shadow of Death, and my vanished youth,<BR>
And the throbbing heart that beats its own drum to the grave,<BR>
Returning absurdly again to the fact that we won,<BR>
Content to let darkness deepen, and stars shine.<BR>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
